## 🏠 Description
<a name="-description"></a>
This repository is an official implementation of the deployment of "HOMIE: Humanoid Loco-Manipulation with Isomorphic Exoskeleton Cockpit". It requires an `Unitree G1` with `Dex-3 hands` and a personal computer. All communications between the robot and the PC are via Wi-Fi. Our code is based on [Walk-These-Ways](https://github.com/Improbable-AI/walk-these-ways) and [Unitree SDK2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2). Our [hardware system](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/HomieHardware) is also open-sourced, you can first refer to it to reimplement the teleoperation system. Once you successfully build a system, you can follow the instructions in the [Usage](#-use). For simple usage of our cockpit, we just provide an example checkpoint named `deploy.onnx`.

## 📚 Usage
<a name="-use"></a>

### Unitree G1
**NOTE:** It is recommended that you connect a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse to the Unitree G1 to use the board on it as a computer.

First of all, you should install `PyTorch` on the Nvidia Jetson Orin of the Unitree G1, which is different from the process on a normal Ubuntu PC. For this step, please refer to the official [instruction](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-pytorch-jetson-platform/index.html).

Then, you can use any ways to put this code to the Orin and enter the directory. Install the required packages by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For controlling robot, we use the cpp-based Unitree SDK2, which means you should first compile the `g1_control.cpp` for `Unitree G1` and `hand_control.cpp` for `Dex-3`. We have prepared the required `CMakeLists.txt` for you, so you only need to run the following command lines:
```
cd unitree_sdk2
rm -rf build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Then the runnable binary files will be in `unitree_sdk2/build/bin`.
You also need to install the  `g1_gym_deploy` by running:
```
cd g1_gym_deploy && pip install -e .
```

### Deployment
**Before deployment, please run L1+A L2+R2 L2+A L2+B to close G1's initial control process, if successful, you will see the robot hang up its arm after L2+A and lose efforts after L2+B.**

For TCP communications, you should determine the IP address of your PC and robot by running:
```
ifconfig | grep inet
```
Set the IP addresses in the code to the correct value.

A. Run the hand control program on `robot` (robot terminal 3):
```
cd unitree_sdk2/build/bin && ./hand_control
```
B. Run the robot control program on `robot` (robot terminal 4):
```
cd unitree_sdk2/build/bin && ./g1_control eth0 (or eth1)
```
C. Run the inference thread to make policy control robot on `robot` (robot terminal 5):
```
python g1_gym_deploy/scripts/deploy_policy.py
```
D. After putting the robot on the ground, push the `R2` button of the joysticker, make the robot stand on the ground, and push `R2` again.

***NOTE:*** We strongly recommend you to really deploy the system after you really understand function of all files, otherwise there can be some troubles.
